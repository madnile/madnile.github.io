  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    My name is Emad Elniel. I am a student, athlete, and creative who is always
    looking to improve and learn new skills. I enjoy challenging myself and
    working toward long term goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Basketball has been an important part of my life. It has taught me
    discipline, teamwork, and how to stay focused under pressure. These lessons
    have helped me both on and off the court.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along with sports, I am interested in digital media and technology. I enjoy
    learning how websites are built and how design and code work together to
    create a good user experience.

  <h2>My Interests and Goals</h2>

  <p>
    I am interested in content creation, digital marketing, and web development.
    I like working on projects that allow me to be creative while also learning
    technical skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to continue improving my skills and eventually use them in
    professional settings. This website is one step in that process and will
    continue to grow as I learn more.

  <h2>Why This Website Matters</h2>

  <p>
    This website was built to meet the requirements of my web development class,
    but it also gives me a platform to show my progress. It demonstrates my
    ability to structure pages, style content, and add basic interactivity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, I plan to refine the design, add new features, and expand the
    content as my skills develop.
