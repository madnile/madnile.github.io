  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to my personal website. This site was created as part of my web
    development course, but it also reflects who I am and what I am working
    toward.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am interested in basketball, digital media, and creative projects. I enjoy
    learning how things work and building skills that I can use in the real
    world. This website is a place where I can share my experiences and practice
    what I am learning.

<!-- PURPOSE -->

  <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this website is to show my understanding of HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript while also creating something personal and meaningful. Each page
    on this site serves a purpose and is designed to be easy to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I continue learning web development, I plan to update this site with new
    features, better design, and more content.
